## Highlighting

Creating a color-coded highlighting system is a great way to organize your notes and make important information stand out. Here are six categories you can use, along with suggested colors:

- <span style="color:#f74e48; background:#f74e48">XX</span> **Important Quotes/Statements** Highlight significant quotes, impactful statements, or excerpts that are particularly well-articulated or thought-provoking.
- <span style="color:#f79938; background:#f79938">XX</span> **Questions/Clarifications** Use this color for any questions, points that need further clarification, or areas where you need additional research.
- <span style="color:#f6c93e; background:#f6c93e">XX</span> **Key Concepts** Highlight fundamental ideas, definitions, and central themes.
- <span style="color:#3eca5d; background:#3eca5d">XX</span> **Examples/Case Studies** Highlight real-world applications, case studies, and examples that illustrate the concepts.
- <span style="color:#2a7ef1; background:#2a7ef1">XX</span> **Important Facts/Statistics** Use this color for crucial data points, figures, and factual information essential for understanding the material.
- <span style="color:#a960c9; background:#a960c9">XX</span> **Action Items/Tasks** Use this color to mark tasks, assignments, or actions you need to take based on the material, such as follow-up readings or experiments.

Whenever possible, use the following color specifications.

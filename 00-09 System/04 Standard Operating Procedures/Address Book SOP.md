## Address Book

### Tags

I use a number of tags that allow me to do smart groups. It means I can touch a contact card once, and it automatically updates across my address book and devices as needed.

A general note: I’ve designed my tag system so that I can do quick updates. For instance, a _\#coworker_ quickly becomes _\#formercoworker_ if either one of us change jobs just by adding _former_ to the tag. It becomes usable in a different smart group.

An important note: Tags don’t replace good metadata. But I also like to keep my metadata up-to-date. For instance, people change jobs. The _Company_ field is a good piece of active data, but becomes irrelevant for [smart groups](https://notes.leahferguson.com/00+Meta/04+SOP/Address+Book+SOP#Smart%20Groups) when that person leaves the company. Tags allow me to work on a broader timescale, and are more adaptable.

| Tag                    | Category     | Description                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| \#companyname (varies) | Professional | A tag for each company I've worked at. |
|                        |              |                                        |

### Temporary Tags


### Smart Groups

This is where the [tag-based](https://notes.leahferguson.com/00+Meta/04+SOP/Address+Book+SOP#Tags) magic happens. And honestly, it’s not all that magical… it just means I don’t have to manually drag cards into groups. I find it’s easier to remember to fillout tags in the note section over manually filing things.

One important note when setting up Smart Groups is to change matching _any_ conditions to _all_ conditions.

| Smart Group | Tags  | Category     | Description |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Coworkers   | \#NCR | Professional | All current co-workers.            |

# 04.12 Daily Log Action Fields

>[!info]
>This SOP describes the _action_ keywords used in the _Daily Log_ section of the daily notes.

The idea is that `log-<ACTION>::` is the format for adding items. `<ACTION>` will be defined here but can be any word until the SOP is updated.

- `log-podcast:: <START-TIME> <PODCAST-TITLE>` - Records a podcast being listened to using a Shortcut.
- `log-workout:: <START-TIME> type:<WORKOUT-ACTIVITY-TYPE> start:<START-TIME> end:<END-TIME> duration:<DURATION> distance:<TOTAL-DISTANCE> energy:<TOTAL-ENERGY-BURNED>` - Records a workout using a Shortcut.
- `log-highlight:: <HIGHLIGHT-TEXT` - Records text that highlights data and is resurfaced in weekly and monthly notes.
